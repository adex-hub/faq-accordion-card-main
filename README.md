## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS (SCSS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- javaScript

### What I learned

I learnt that in order not to make elements of a parent div exceed the parent div, 

```css
  .sample-css {
    overflow: hidden;
  }
```
needs to be added to the parent div.

### Continued development

In my next project I am going to be working with JSON which I am not that good at in order to improve my skills.
